## TODOs
- [ ] Check if cuntionality to addTransaction works good
- [ ] Check if there is a better way to interact with components in a page and their calls, for example in addTransaction I am not sure if i want to refresh the funds from there.
- [ ] I have seen that when the fastapi is not runing pages in vue are not protected. (does not give any data back thoug) (Maybe the token is wrong, i changed the other day)
